# Breast-DCE-MRI-Completed-Annotations
Included are the Ground Truth of 11 cases used in our study that were completed with the help of an experienced radiologist in order to include all the other lesions that were not initially segmented (secondary lesions) in the originally provided Ground Truth labels.
Cases were taken from a subset of the TCGA-BRCA collection with the Tissue Source Site code: BH.
The TCGA-BRCA collection was collected by the TCGA Breast Phenotype Research Group and made available in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)(http://http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net).
